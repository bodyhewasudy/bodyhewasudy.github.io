Consider reclining seats, sofas, or bean bags for maximum comfort during long movie marathons.\nErgonomics Matter: Place your TV at the right height to avoid neck strain. The best position is slightly below eye level when seated.\nFinding the Sweet Spot: Locate the perfect spot for the front row seating, ensuring a clear view of the entire screen without feeling too close or too far.
