Failing to Research and Compare Builders: Mistake: Rushing into a decision without proper research. Solution: Diligently research potential builders, read reviews, and compare their portfolios to find the best fit for your project. 2. Overlooking Credentials and Experience: Mistake: Hiring a builder solely based on price or proximity. Solution: Ensure the builder is licensed, insured, and has a proven track record of successful projects similar to yours. 3.

Solution: Insist on a detailed contract outlining the project scope, budget, timeline, and payment terms. This protects both parties. 4. Ignoring Communication and Transparency: Mistake: Hiring a builder who lacks communication skills or transparency. Solution: Choose a builder who is responsive, transparent about project progress, and willing to address your concerns promptly. 5.

Solution: Verify the builder has liability insurance, property damage insurance, and workers’ compensation insurance to protect yourself and your property. 9.

Solution: Establish a payment schedule based on project milestones and progress. Avoid paying large sums upfront, and always inspect the work before releasing payments. 10.
