The more experience they have, the smoother your building journey is likely to be.</p><h3 id=2-licensing-and-insurance><strong>2. Licensing and Insurance</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-licensing-and-insurance>#</a></h3><p>In the wild world of construction, it&rsquo;s not just about talent; it&rsquo;s about following the rules too.

Reputation and Reliability</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-reputation-and-reliability>#</a></h3><p>Reputation is everything in the construction business. Dig deep into online reviews, ask for recommendations, and chat with people who&rsquo;ve worked with the company before. A solid reputation speaks volumes about their work ethic, quality, and professionalism. Plus, reliability is key. You don&rsquo;t want a company that vanishes halfway through the project, leaving you hanging.</p><h3 id=4-clear-communication-and-transparency><strong>4. Clear Communication and Transparency</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#4-clear-communication-and-transparency>#</a></h3><p>Building a new space should be a collaborative journey.
