Always hire a qualified electrician for installation and maintenance to minimize these risks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improper Bulb Selection:</strong> Using bulbs with higher wattage than recommended can lead to overheating and potential fire hazards. Choose bulbs that match the specified wattage for your mini pot lights.</p></li></ul><h3 id=key-takeaways-1><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#key-takeaways-1>#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Flickering lights:</strong> Check for loose connections, faulty bulbs, or overloaded circuits.</li><li><strong>Uneven brightness:</strong> Ensure bulbs have the same wattage, check dimmer switch compatibility, and verify proper installation.</li><li><strong>Safety concerns:</strong> Avoid overheating by ensuring adequate insulation, hire a qualified electrician for installation, and use bulbs with appropriate wattage.</li></ul><p>Remember, if you&rsquo;re unsure about troubleshooting any of these issues, it&rsquo;s always advisable to consult a qualified electrician for professional assistance.
